# InjusticeJudge

Analyzes your tenhou.net game to find instances of mahjong injustice. Currently, it checks for:

- Getting chased and dealing into a worse wait
- You tenpai first but someone else wins with a worse wait
- You experience iishanten hell (9+ draws)

## Usage

Clone this and run with `python main.py '<tenhou url>'`, outputs to console

## High level TODOs

- detect first row win by someone else 
- detect when your big tenpai hand is destroyed by a dama low value hand
- detect riichi ippatsu tsumo
- detect when you're dealer and someone's tsumo flipped your placement
